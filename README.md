## About Me
Hello! I'm Dhanush, I am a network engineer by profession, a Software Engineer in the making. I have 2 years of experience in L2/L3 and Service Provider teams at Cisco and I am passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems Management, where I focus on the intersection of software engineering, data science, and disruptive technologies.

When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously learning to stay ahead in this fast-paced industry. I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you through this portfolio!

## What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I aim to deepen my understanding of data visualization and effective communication of complex information. I'm particularly interested in learning how to design and implement interactive data visualizations that can be integrated into real-world applications. After graduation, I plan to work on projects that combine my software engineering skills with data science to drive impactful change in the tech industry.
