## Government Debt Bar Chart

General government debt is the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP.

Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories where applicable: currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. A key indicator for the sustainability of government finance, changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

This indicator is measured as a percentage of GDP.
