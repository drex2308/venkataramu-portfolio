 # Wireframes / storyboards

The detaliled project structure from part 1 enabled me to refine how I tell my story through the approriate hook, facts and data visualizations in this phase. Describing my research and insights on this topic that was very inspirational to me was exciting, I told my story with my research and findings with relevant images and data visualizations.
Using Shorthand, I designed the elements that play a crucial role in story telling, choosing a color theme to reflect my topic, layout to persuade my viewers to hop on the opportunity I was presenting. I made the visualization as interactive as possible  to keep the users engaged (embedding the tableau links), help users navigate and reveal information on user engagement.
Finding relevant datasets that shed more light and context to the story I was building, integrated them in Tableau, creating visualizations that I can embed in Tableau.

This is the [My Story website](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.co) I created on "The Growing Demand for Indian Food Products in the USA".

## Challenges

1. I found it challenging to find the dataset, especially on the insights I wanted to shed on current agricultural standing in India, its leading product export to USA and correlation to forecast in the future.
2. I found it challenging before the interviews and in-class crtitique to get a proper hook for my story and my user base focus, which audience would I cater my story to and what exactly would they want to know.
3. Visualizing with Tableau was hard in the beginning since I am using the tool for the first time, but I had a lot of help thorough online tutorials and LLMs when I found it hard to navigate through Tableau features.


## User Research

#### Approach to Identifying Interviewees

After much thought into the data insights and in-class crtiques, I have found my users, talking to an audience that knew abiut agriculatural exports and export based investements in general was very crucial to structure the story I wanted to tell. Also getting feedback from a set of eyes that does not have much information on exports but interets in farming was crucuial. This way I could get feedback from different perspectives.


### Target Audience

For my target audience, I chose a mix of individuals with varied knowledge about agricultural exports and farming investments to gather diverse insights. It was crucial to get feedback from people who are familiar with export-based investments, as they can provide nuanced feedback on the structure and relevance of my narrative. Equally important was hearing from individuals who may not have expertise in exports but have a vested interest in farming, as their fresh perspectives offer valuable insights into how to make the story more accessible.


I interviewed three individuals representing various aspects of my target audience:
1. **An agricultural economist in their early 30s**, familiar with the dynamics of global food trade and export-based investments. Their expertise was vital for understanding the potential of Indian agricultural exports.
2. **A farmer in their late 20s** who is relatively new to the concept of exports but keen on exploring the opportunities for global market entry. Their fresh perspective on how to communicate these opportunities was critical.
3. **An agricultural investor in their mid-40s**, focused on emerging markets and sustainable investments. Their input helped shape the narrative to be more persuasive for investors.

## User Research Findings

After conducting interviews with my selected audience, I documented several key insights and observations that will help refine my final project:

| Questions                            | Interview 1 (Economist, 30's)          | Interview 2 (Farmer, 20's)          | Interview 3 (Investor, 40's)           |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| How familiar are you with Indian agricultural exports and their importance in the U.S. market? | Familiar, well-versed in global food trade | Somewhat familiar, curious about potential | Aware, keen to explore investment potential |
| What do you think are the main drivers behind the growing demand for Indian agricultural products in the U.S.? | Growth of Indian diaspora, consumer demand for spices | "It's exciting to see more people in the U.S. appreciating Indian food products" | Demand for unique and organic products |
| How do you perceive the long-term potential of Indian farmers engaging with the U.S. market? | "India could become a major player in agricultural exports, given the demand trends." | "It feels like the right time to start thinking bigger, but we need more support." | "Huge opportunity for investors looking for long-term, sustainable growth." |
| Did the initial story outline engage you and make you consider the investment opportunities in Indian agriculture? | Yes, especially when it highlighted the economic growth potential. | "I liked the overall idea, but more clarity on logistics is needed." | Definitely—seeing the growth numbers was very persuasive. |
| Were the visualizations (charts, graphs) compelling, or did any part feel unclear? | The growth charts were clear and impactful. | "The pie chart could use more context to explain the data." | The line chart on export trends was well-designed and informative. |
| How could the narrative be refined to better emphasize the benefits of Indian exports? | Focus more on the long-term impact on India's economy. | "Highlight the personal stories of small farmers—show the human side." | More data on the projected growth of the U.S. market for these products would be useful. |
| Do you feel a personal connection to the success of Indian farmers in the global market? | Yes, it's critical for global food security and economic growth. | "I could see how this would personally impact my farm's growth." | "Absolutely—this aligns with my focus on investing in emerging markets." |
| What suggestions do you have to make the story more persuasive and impactful for both upcoming farmers and investors? | Include real-life case studies of farmers benefitting from exports. | Simplify the explanation of export logistics for small farmers. | Emphasize the long-term scalability and sustainability of this opportunity. |

### Conclusion

This user research provided invaluable insights into how I can refine my narrative and visualizations to better engage both experienced investors and upcoming farmers. By integrating user success stories, improving visual clarity, and emphasizing sustainable practices, I will create a more compelling and accessible story in Part III of my project.
